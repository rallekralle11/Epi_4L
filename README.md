With such "amazing" features as:

Data line ESD protection taken from the official A. micro.

Crenellated pins.

No integrated voltage converter, only runs at 4,5-5,5v(down to 2,7 if you make it with an 8mhz crystal, or use the internal oscillator).

USB-C connector sunk into the board, and slighly portruding from the end for panel mounting.

1,27mm pin spacing.

Extra pins broken out.

Way too many hours routing for my sanity, and i doubt it's optimal(i am a beginner).

Holes where M2 bolts can be used to hold it in place.

No rx/tx/power LEDs. Only one on pin 13 for testing.

Includes some custom footprints with 3D models.
